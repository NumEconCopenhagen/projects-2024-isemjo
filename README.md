1. Inaugural project.  

Our project is titled The Solow Model with Land.

This project implements an extended version of the Solow growth model, incorporating not only traditional inputs like capital and labor but also land and exhaustible natural resources. It uses numerical methods to find the steady state of the capital-output ratio under different parameter settings.

Features:

Solow Growth Model Implementation: Extends the basic Solow model to include land and exhaustible natural resources.
Multi-Start Optimization: Employs a multi-start optimization approach to robustly find the steady state solutions.
Interactive Visualization: Utilizes interactive sliders to dynamically explore how changes in model parameters affect the steady state.
