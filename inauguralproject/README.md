# Inaugural project

In this project we examine different outcomes for an exchange economy defined for for two agents, A and B, and two goods. We define and illustrate the pareto efficent allocations in and Edgeworth box. We then solve for the market clearing price by calculating the error in the market clearing condition. We solve for the optimal allocations given that agent A maximizes her own utility and after, that A maximizes her utility given that agent B's utility cannot be worse than his intital endowment. 
In the end we solve the social planner problem and compare all the allocations in the Edgeworth box. We see that all the allocations are in the pareto efficient area. 

We also solve and simulate a pre-specified economic model where we visualize the results. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
