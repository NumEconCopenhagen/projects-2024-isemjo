# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow Model with Land**. 

This project implements an extended version of the Solow growth model, incorporating not only traditional inputs like capital and labor but also land and exhaustible natural resources. It uses numerical methods to find the steady state of the capital-output ratio under different parameter settings.

Contents
- `modelprojectexam.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the Solow Growth Model and its extensions.
- `modelprojectexam.py`: Python script with the core functions and classes used in the notebook.

Features:
- Solow Growth Model: Extends the Solow model to include land and exhaustible natural resources.
- Interactive Plots: Users can interact with sliders to adjust model parameters.
- Steady-State Analysis: Calculation and visualization of the steady-state levels of capital-output ratio.
