# Data analysis project

Our project is titled Income distrubution in Denmark and is about illustrating the income distrubution in Denmark based on region and age. We use data from Danmarks statistik through and an API.
We find that income has been increasing in all regions in Denmark from 2013 to 2022. The income is greatest in the region 'Hovedstaden' and the least in 'Nordjylland' for all years, which most likely is because of 'Hovedstaden' including the capital of Denmark. Generally we would expect to see more higher-salary jobs in capitals and larger citites. We show the mean and median income for all regions and age groups in 2022. We see that the income is increasing in age groups but tops at the age group 50-54 whereafter it falls. This is presumably because young people are studying and earning a lower wage for the first years of their careers whereafter salaries increase with more experience in the job market/senior positions. The fall in income in the older age groups is most likely caused by more people retiring in these groups and switching to pensions that provides a lower income than working.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. LONS50 (Danmarks statistik) 
1. LONS30 (Danmarks statistik)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
