# Data analysis project

Our project is titled Income distrubution in Denmark and is about illustrating the income distrubution in Denmark based on region and age. We find that income has been increasing in all regions in Denmark from 2013 to 2022, but has incrased most in the region 'Hovedstaden' and the least in 'Nordjylland', which most likely is because of 'Hovedstaden' including the capital of Denmark. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. dataX.csv (*source*) 
1. dataY.csv (*source*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
